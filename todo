> > > Question NEED To Be Asked<<<

- There are hinits to a login process but isn't explicit said, How should we deal with nonlogin page to login one?
- For each page do we just click and transistion to that page?
- There is a circle up arrow on the lower right of each page. Should I incorporate a function to back up to the top of the page?
- No responsive desing for now, just desktop?
- is the navbar sticky?
